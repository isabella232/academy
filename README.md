# Rancher Academy Issues Repository

Hello! Did you find an issue with the [Rancher Academy](https://academy.rancher.com), or do you have a suggestion?

If so, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rancher/academy/issues) and we'll take a look.

If you're going through the course and you have a question about how to perform any of the tasks within it, instead of opening an issue here, please visit `#academy` on the [Rancher Users Slack](https://slack.rancher.io). There you'll find hundreds of other students and Rancher staff who can help you.
